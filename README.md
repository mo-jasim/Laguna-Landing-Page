# Laguna-Landing-Page

This landing page was originally intended for one of my clients who unexpectedly disappeared. The project was supposed to be a hotel and travel booking website, but midway through, the client became unresponsive. Despite the setback, I didn’t let it discourage me. Instead, I turned it into a personal project and developed this landing page as a hobby using React.js.
